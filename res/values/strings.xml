    <string name="theatomquestion1">What information is necessary to determine the atomic mass of the element Chlorine?</string>
    <string name="theatomquestion1a">a.  the atomic mass of each artificially produced isotope of chlorine, only</string>
    <string name="theatomquestion1b">b.  the relative abundance of each naturally occurring isotope of chlorine, only</string>
    <string name="theatomquestion1c">c.  the atomic mass and the relative abundance of each naturally occurring isotope of chlorine</string>
    <string name="theatomquestion1d">d.  the atomic mass and the relative abundance of each naturally occurring and artificially produced isotope of chlorine</string>
    <string name="theatomquestion1ans">theatomquestion1c</string>
    <string name="theatomquestion1exp">The atomic mass of an atom, in this case Chlorine, is calculated by multiplying the masses of each chlorine isotope by its percent abundance and then dividing by 100. This gives you the weighted atomic mass, which number is found on the periodic table.</string>
    
    <string name="theatomquestion2">An atom of aluminum in the ground state and an atom of gallium in the ground state have the same </string>
    <string name="theatomquestion2a">a.  mass</string>
    <string name="theatomquestion2b">b.  electronegativity</string>
    <string name="theatomquestion2c">c.  total number of protons</string>
    <string name="theatomquestion2d">d.  total number of valence electrons</string>
    <string name="theatomquestion2ans">theatomquestion2d</string>
    <string name="theatomquestion2exp">Aluminum and Gallium are both found in group 13, which contains 3 valence electrons, therefore they both have 3 valence electrons on their outer shell.</string>
